# Sleep Stage Detection from Sleep EDF Files
This project focuses on detecting different sleep stages (e.g., wakefulness, NREM, REM) using Sleep-EDF dataset files. The system processes polysomnographic data (EEG, EOG, EMG) to classify sleep phases and provide insights into sleep quality.

# Dataset
The project uses the [Sleep-EDF dataset](https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/sleep-cassette/), which contains EEG recordings and corresponding sleep stage annotations.
